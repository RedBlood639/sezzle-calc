#Design a Calculator

Create a simple calculator which could be used to do basic operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. The calculator should be able to evaluate multi operand expressions and should follow the bodmas rule. It should also support decimal numbers.
Invalid expressions should be handled gracefully.

Example:

Input
2+3+3
Output
8

Input
2+3-3
Output
2

Input
5 / 2 - 3
Output
-0.5

We will emphasise more on code quality, extensibility, testability and Object Oriented Design Principles.
